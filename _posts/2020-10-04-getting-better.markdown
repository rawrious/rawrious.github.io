Honestly, I was just being lazy and didn't want to update my SSH key for pushing to this git. I've been jotting everything down, but haven't really had the time to edit it all and push it. Here's a quick update of what I've been up to.

<h4>Dissertation and PCB Design:</h4>
After all the pain and suffering of figuring out why the board wouldn't work, it boiled down to one dumb mistake >> I had a capacitor that was too big and, because I decided to use a ground plane throughout the board, I was able to just scratch off some of the purple OSH coating and use it as a second pad. What I didn't know was that I should have completely scratched off the original pad as well. BUT IT IS NOW UP AND RUNNING!

<h4>Brainlab Analysis:</h4>
Well the initial analysis is done and the results weren't great. So now I'm preprocessing the data a little differently (1. using smaller chunks of data and 2. using 1s before the stimuli was presented). Hopefully these will provide better results :)

<h4>Derm Tech Chapter:</h4>
A colleague and myself were asked to write a chapter on the "Future of Technology and Computers in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dermatologic Diseases" for Veterinarians. We're almost done and hopefully it'll be an interesting read.
