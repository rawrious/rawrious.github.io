Things I completed these last two days:

- Finalized the prep for the interview
- GVU Brown Bag: Gregory Abowd on "Using digital technologies to support pandemic response on campus: A case study in the opportunities and challenges of WiFi."
- Met with a student who will be designing a dashboard for the Smart Toys! I'm really excited for this project.

To prep for this weekend:
- Meeting with a student to discuss potential research this semester.



**Interview Prep Tips:**
Despite this being over Zoom, it’s a print media interview. Media writes a story for their consumer. I mean, a lot of academia is all about getting the right “storyline” too so there’s nothing to be upset about. However, sometimes things (https://xkcd.com/882/) can be misinterpreted and you want to try to present your research as accurately as possible so this doesn’t happen. Here’s how I prep for print interviews:
- You are usually provided a little bit of context surrounding the topic of the article they’re writing. For example, I’ve been provided with this: “To give a little context, I work for XYZ, and the article I’m writing reviews studies that analyze animal vocalizations and facial expressions using machine learning. I want to make sure I’m adding enough depth to give people an accurate sense of the current state of this research, the challenges, the successes, and the future directions. Given your expertise, I think the article would greatly benefit from your insight.” <— THIS IS GREAT, I can use this to tailor the more general questions surrounding my research. 
- I write out specific answers to some of the more general questions. For example, you’ll typically get a question like “Can you talk me through your research” or “How did you determine the factors in the ball and tug toy to measure up which dogs would work the best?” or “Why is it important to do this research?”
- If you don’t know the answer to a question or you’re asked to draw conclusions that aren’t accurate, just say so. I like the way the APA frames it: “Explain the difference between preliminary research results and "known" behavioral science.


Other tips: 
- Be respectful and be friendly. Writers are just doing their job like you’re doing yours. Nobody needs your shit.
