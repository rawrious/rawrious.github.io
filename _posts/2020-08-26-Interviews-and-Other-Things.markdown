- Met with a student who will be designing a dashboard for the Smart Toys! I'm really excited for this project.

<h4>To prep for Monday:</h4>
- My hard goal is to finish debugging the board for the Smart Toys.
- My easy goal is to get this ACI paper finished.

<h4>Notes on how I feel about life, PhD, and everything related to 42:</h4>
I've been in a funk the past couple of days. It's been a lot of doing things for other people and not a whole lot of working on the things related to my research. The ACI paper has to go out Monday, and our internal deadline is for Saturday (GMT+4) so at some point this is going to have to get finished. Unsure as to when though since I'm helping someone learn to drive Saturday morning.

Anyways, I figured I'd document some of the prep steps I took for the media interview that happened on Thursday. The writer was really easy to talk to and the conversation flowed pretty smoothly. 

<h5>Interview Prep Tips:</h5>
Despite this being over Zoom, it’s a print media interview. Media writes a story for their consumer. I mean, a lot of academia is all about getting the right “storyline” too so there’s nothing to be upset about. However, sometimes things (https://xkcd.com/882/) can be misinterpreted and you want to try to present your research as accurately as possible so this doesn’t happen. Here’s how I prep for print interviews:
- You are usually provided a little bit of context surrounding the topic of the article they’re writing. For example, I’ve been provided with this: “To give a little context, I work for XYZ, and the article I’m writing reviews studies that analyze animal vocalizations and facial expressions using machine learning. I want to make sure I’m adding enough depth to give people an accurate sense of the current state of this research, the challenges, the successes, and the future directions. Given your expertise, I think the article would greatly benefit from your insight.” <— THIS IS GREAT, I can use this to tailor the more general questions surrounding my research. 
- I write out specific answers to some of the more general questions. For example, you’ll typically get a question like “Can you talk me through your research” or “How did you determine the factors in the ball and tug toy to measure up which dogs would work the best?” or “Why is it important to do this research?”
- If you don’t know the answer to a question or you’re asked to draw conclusions that aren’t accurate, just say so. I like the way the APA frames it: “Explain the difference between preliminary research results and "known" behavioral science.

<h5>Other tips:</h5> 
- Be respectful and be friendly. Writers are just doing their job like you’re doing yours. Nobody needs your shit.
